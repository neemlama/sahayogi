"""Form inspection tools — two variants, one shared output shape.

inspect_form: the cloud path — visits an arbitrary URL via AgentCore
Browser and reads back its form structure. No pre-built map; the agent
discovers field labels, types, and selectors live from whatever HTML the
page actually returns.

inspect_provided_html: the Chrome-extension path — same discovery job, but
the HTML is handed to it directly (the extension's content script already
read the user's open tab) instead of fetched by driving a remote browser.
No AgentCore Browser dependency at all for this path.

Both are isolated Strands Agents, same pattern as document_parser's vision
extractor — callback_handler=None because tool-call chatter isn't
user-facing. Both are direct @tool functions (unlike form_filler) since
they're read-only — no approval boundary to protect.

Deliberate scope limits, stated rather than silently assumed:
  - Reads the FIRST <form> found on the page. Multi-form pages (e.g. a
    search box plus the actual RSVP form) may need a hint; not handled.
  - No login walls, no CAPTCHA solving, no JS-heavy SPA forms that render
    fields after complex interaction. Static/server-rendered forms only.
  - Neither fills or submits anything -- read-only.

Cost note: both inspectors run on Haiku, not the default Sonnet. Reading
labels/types/selectors out of HTML is structured extraction, not judgment
-- it doesn't need a frontier model, and inspect_form's browser-driving
loop in particular racks up many sequential calls (one per browser action),
each at Sonnet's 5x-pricier output-token rate otherwise. The orchestrator
itself (agent/orchestrator.py) stays on the default model -- that's where
matching a form against a real person's info under ambiguity actually
needs the stronger model.

For every field, determine:
  - label: the human-readable label (from an associated <label>, aria-label, \
    placeholder, or nearby text -- best guess if ambiguous). For grid questions, \
    include row label: e.g. "Food quality (Rate 1-5)" or "Availability [Monday]".
  - field_type: one of "text", "email", "tel", "number", "date", "time", \
    "textarea", "select", "radio", "checkbox", "file", "rating", "linear_scale", "grid_radio", "grid_checkbox"
    * text/email/tel/number/textarea = short answer / paragraph / typed inputs
    * select = dropdown (Google Forms: div[role=listbox] / div[role=option])
    * radio = multiple-choice single-select (Google Forms: div[role=radio][data-value])
    * checkbox = multiple-select (Google Forms: div[role=checkbox][data-value])
    * file = file upload (Google Forms: input[type=file] or "Add file" button inside listitem with data-params)
    * date = date picker (Google Forms: input[type=date] or 3 inputs + placeholder MM DD YYYY)
    * time = time picker (Google Forms: hour/minute inputs + AM/PM select, or input[type=time])
    * rating / linear_scale = linear scale 1-5 etc. (Google Forms: row of div[role=radio] with numeric data-value)
    * grid_radio / grid_checkbox = multiple-choice / checkbox grid (rows x columns, each cell is radio/checkbox)
  - selector: a CSS selector you could use to target this exact element -- \
    strongly prefer "#id" if the element has an id, otherwise a \
    name= attribute selector '[name="entry.XXXXXXX"]' for Google Forms, otherwise the most specific selector you can \
    construct. For grid, return the row's selector; the filler will select the column value.
  - options: for "select", "radio", "checkbox", "rating", "linear_scale", "grid_radio", "grid_checkbox" fields, the list of visible option text values (for grid: column headers); \
    null for everything else (text/date/time/file)
  - required: true if the element has a required attribute or is visually/\
    textually marked required (e.g. an asterisk, or aria-required=true on Google Forms listitem)

Also identify submit_selector: a CSS selector for the form's submit \
button (Google Forms: div[role=button][jsname] with text "Submit" / "Send").

Respond with ONLY a single JSON object, no prose, no markdown fence:
{"ok": true|false, "fields": [{"label": "...", "field_type": "...", \
"selector": "...", "options": null, "required": true|false}, ...], \
"submit_selector": "...", "notes": "<anything unusual: no form found, \
login wall, CAPTCHA, JS-rendered content that didn't load, etc>"}

If you cannot find a usable form, set "ok": false and explain why in \
notes -- do not invent fields that aren't really there.
"""

_INSPECTOR_PROMPT = f"""\
You are inspecting a web form, not filling it out. Navigate to the given \
URL (use init_session first, then navigate), then use get_html to read the \
page's HTML source. Find the first <form> on the page (or the most \
prominent set of input fields if there's no explicit <form> tag).
Every div[role=listitem] on Google Forms is one question — count them all, even if 15+.

Google Forms type mapping (same as HTML inspector):
- div[role=radio][data-value] → radio (if numeric 1-5 with scale/rate label → linear_scale/rating)
- div[role=checkbox][data-value] → checkbox
- div[role=listbox]+div[role=option] → select (dropdown)
- input[type=file] / "Add file" → file
- date: MM DD YYYY placeholder or input[type=date] → date
- time: HH : MM + AM/PM → time
- table with radio/checkbox cells → grid_radio / grid_checkbox (one field per row)

CAPTCHA present, page didn't load.)
"""

_HTML_INSPECTOR_PROMPT = f"""\
You are inspecting HTML from a web form. This HTML was NOT fetched by \
you — it was read directly from the user's own open browser tab by a \
Chrome extension and handed to you as text. Do not attempt to navigate \
anywhere; just read the given HTML. Find the first <form> in it (or the \
most prominent set of input fields if there's no explicit <form> tag).
Every div[role=listitem] on Google Forms is one question — count them all, even if 15+.

Special handling for Google Forms (docs.google.com/forms): the real \
fields are inputs with name="entry.XXXXXXX" (often inside div[role=listitem]), \
and the visible textbox may be div[role=textbox] or textarea. Always \
return selector '[name="entry.XXXXXXX"]' for those (strongly preferred \
over a generated id), and map the visible question text as label.

Google Forms type mapping (detect via aria + structure, not input type alone):
- div[role=radio][data-value] inside listitem without grid table → field_type "radio", options = each data-value/text, selector = '[name="entry.XXXX"]' if hidden input exists else listitem selector. If options are numeric 1-5 and label contains "scale"/"rate"/"rating" → use "linear_scale" or "rating".
- div[role=checkbox][data-value] → "checkbox"
- div[role=listbox] + div[role=option] → "select" (dropdown)
- input[type=file] OR div containing "Add file" / "Upload" button + hidden input → "file", options=null
- Date: look for placeholder "MM DD YYYY" or 3 inputs + year/month/day labels, or input[type=date] → "date"
- Time: look for "HH : MM" placeholder or hour/minute inputs + AM/PM select, or input[type=time] → "time"
- Linear scale: single row with radio 1..N (often 1-5, 1-10) → "linear_scale" or "rating"
- Grid: table with rows as sub-questions and columns as headers, cells contain radio/checkbox → "grid_radio" (if radio) or "grid_checkbox" (if checkbox), options = column headers, label = overall grid title + row label for each row entry (emit one field per row).
